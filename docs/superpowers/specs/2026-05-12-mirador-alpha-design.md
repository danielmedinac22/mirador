# Mirador Alpha — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-05-12
**Status:** Draft (pending review)
**Author:** daniel.medina@simetrik.com
**Scope:** Public alpha release. Skill-only product, BYO Vercel. The hosted SaaS lives in the V1 spec (`2026-05-12-mirador-design.md`).

---

## 1. Vision

Ship the smallest possible thing that proves the wedge: **after Claude generates an HTML artifact, the user can have a shareable URL in under a minute, without us hosting anything.**

The alpha is a Claude Code skill plus a thin CLI. It uses **the user's own Vercel account** as the hosting layer. Mirador adds the workflow, the theming, and the UX — Vercel does the bytes-on-the-internet part.

The alpha is a stepping stone. The V1 spec replaces Vercel with our own runtime once we have validated demand.

---

## 2. What's in scope

1. A Claude Code skill that activates when the agent has produced HTML in the session.
2. A Node CLI installed alongside the skill, with two public commands:
   - `mirador share <file>` — main flow
   - `mirador list` — view & manage your shared docs
3. A guided first-run that authenticates Vercel and creates the user's Mirador project.
4. A guided share flow that asks the user (through the skill, conversationally):
   - **name** (slug)
   - **theme** (default / pick / generate from reference)
   - **password** (no password / soft client-side gate)
   - **visibility** (unlisted link-only / public listed on index)
5. A theme system with:
   - 3 shipped themes: `default`, `deck`, `memo`, plus a pseudo-theme `none` (publish verbatim, no wrapping)
   - The ability to **generate a custom theme from a reference** — URL, screenshot, or natural-language description
   - Local persistence in `~/.mirador/themes/` so generated themes can be reused
6. A local static site that the CLI maintains and deploys to Vercel on each share.
7. Soft password gate (client-side JS) for password-protected docs.
8. A README + GIF demo + 5-minute quickstart.
9. Distribution: `curl ... | bash` one-line installer, plus `npm i -g @mirador/cli` for those who prefer it.

## 3. What's NOT in scope

Anything that requires our backend or a managed runtime. Everything below moves to V1:

- Comments / forks / version history / multi-player
- Server-side "edit with AI" (the skill can re-generate via Claude in the session, but no API)
- Real authentication / accounts
- Vercel-grade password protection (we only do soft gate; Pro detection is a *nice-to-have* not in MVP, see §11)
- Custom domains
- Analytics
- Audit log
- Embed widget
- Mobile

We also do **not** ship a long list of CLI commands. The visible surface is two commands. Everything else is conversational.

---

## 4. The User Story

> Daniel asks Claude to generate a one-page status report on Q2 results. Claude produces `q2-report.html`. Claude notices the Mirador skill is installed and asks: "Want me to publish this and give you a link?" Daniel says yes. The skill conversationally asks for a name, theme, and whether to password-protect. Daniel says "use the memo theme, no password". 15 seconds later he has a URL on his clipboard and a confirmation in the chat. He DMs it to his manager.

That is the entire alpha. Everything else in this spec exists to make that story work reliably.

### Component boundaries

| Unit | Purpose | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `commands/*` | Top-level CLI command handlers, thin orchestrators | flows, site |
| `flows/*` | Stateful interactive conversations | prompt, config, theme |
| `theme/apply` | Pure function: HTML + theme → themed HTML | sanitizer (DOMPurify) |
| `theme/generate` | Calls Anthropic SDK with a reference, returns a theme | Anthropic SDK |
| `theme/store` | Read/write themes on disk | fs |
| `site/build` | Assembles `~/.mirador/site/` from config + docs | fs |
| `site/deploy` | Shells out to `vercel deploy --prod`, parses output | child_process |
| `config` | Read/write `~/.mirador/config.json` | fs |
| `prompt` | TTY input + selectable lists; abstracted so it's testable | enquirer |

Each unit must be understandable on its own: a one-paragraph header in the file explaining what it does, what its public interface is, and what it depends on. Tests for each unit live next to it (`*.test.ts`).

### How a share runs end-to-end

```
1. CLI: parse `mirador share q2-report.html`
2. config.ensureInitialized()
   └── if no config.json: run flows/init (vercel login + project create)
3. flows/name → ask user for slug, default = filename or <title>
4. flows/theme → ask user:
     - keep default
     - pick from list (3 shipped + user's)
     - generate from reference:
         - paste URL    → fetch HTML/CSS, send to Claude, get theme.css + meta
         - paste image  → vision call to Claude, get theme.css + meta
         - describe     → text-only call to Claude, get theme.css + meta
       → save into ~/.mirador/themes/<name>/, set as choice for this doc
5. flows/password → ask user:
     - none (default)
     - protect → ask for password, hash with PBKDF2, embed gate
6. theme/apply(html, theme) → themed HTML
7. site/build → assembles ~/.mirador/site/ with new doc added
8. site/deploy → `vercel deploy --prod`, captures URL
9. config: persist new doc record
10. print URL + copy to clipboard
```

`mirador list` is a much shorter flow: list docs from config, allow selection to (a) copy URL, (b) open in browser, (c) delete. Delete = remove from `site/d/<slug>/`, redeploy, drop from config.

## 6. The Skill

`SKILL.md` description (draft):

> Use this skill when you have just produced an HTML artifact in the session — a report, dashboard, presentation, document, prototype, or mini-app — and the user might want to view or share it. Wraps the `mirador` CLI to publish the file to the user's own Vercel and return a shareable URL. The skill is conversational: it asks the user about name, theme (with the option to generate one from a URL, screenshot, or description), and optional password protection.

### Trigger heuristic

The skill is *offered*, not auto-invoked: when the agent produces an HTML file, it asks the user "want me to publish this and give you a link?" before running the skill. This keeps it from running unsolicited.

### Conversational contract

The skill must guide the user through the share flow **in chat**, not by spawning interactive TTY prompts the user can't see. That means:

- The skill asks "what should we call it?" → user replies in chat → skill calls `mirador share <file> --name <slug> --non-interactive` with the answer.
- Same for theme and password.
- The CLI exposes a `--non-interactive` mode where every flow input can be passed as a flag, used by the skill. The conversational flows run only when a human invokes the CLI directly from a terminal.

This is the one place where the CLI has more flags than the user types. Those flags are the skill's contract, not the user's UX.

---

## 7. Theme from reference

This is the most interesting feature in the alpha. It uses Claude's vision and reasoning to produce a usable CSS theme from whatever the user has at hand.

### Three input modes

1. **URL** — the user pastes a web page they want their doc to look like. The CLI fetches the HTML and any linked CSS files using a plain HTTP client (no JS execution, no headless browser) and passes the raw text to Claude, which produces a single self-contained `theme.css` that captures the typographic, color, and spacing language. Stylesheets that are too dynamic (JS-driven, gated, login-walled) get a graceful fallback to "couldn't fully fetch, here is a best-effort theme based on the visible structure".
2. **Screenshot** — the user attaches an image. The skill sends the image to Claude (vision) with a prompt that asks for the same `theme.css`. Works for designs that aren't crawlable (Figma exports, paper sketches photographed, designs from other tools).
3. **Description** — the user describes in natural language: "calm, navy and beige, generous whitespace, serif headings, sans body". Pure text-to-theme via Claude.

### Output contract

Every theme generated returns:

```
~/.mirador/themes/<name>/
├── meta.json
│     {
│       "name": "boardish",
│       "description": "Inspired by boardroom decks; cool blues, generous whitespace.",
│       "generated_from": { "type": "url"|"image"|"description", "ref": "..." },
│       "created_at": "..."
│     }
├── theme.css         ← scoped under .mirador-content { ... } to avoid conflicts
└── head.html         ← optional, e.g. Google Fonts <link>
```

The CSS is scoped under `.mirador-content { ... }` (we wrap the user's `<body>` content in a `<div class="mirador-content">` at apply time) so the theme never bleeds into our gate UI or the deployed site's index page.

### What's NOT in the alpha

- Multi-page theme variants
- Theme marketplace / sharing across users
- Editing a generated theme through the skill (the user can hand-edit the CSS file; not a guided flow)

---

## 8. Password gate

Client-side only. Invoked from inside the `share` flow (`flows/password`); it is **not** a standalone CLI command. The flow:

1. User provides a password in the share flow.
2. CLI derives a `key = PBKDF2(password, salt, 200_000, sha-256)`. Stores `salt` and `kdf_iter` in the page.
3. CLI encrypts the themed HTML body with AES-GCM using `key`. The ciphertext is embedded in `index.html` as a base64 string. The salt and IV are in plain text.
4. The page's visible content is the gate UI; the encrypted body is *not* rendered until the user enters the password, the key is re-derived in the browser, and the body is decrypted.

Both ends use the same primitive: the CLI uses Node's `crypto.subtle` (`globalThis.crypto.subtle`, available natively on Node 20+); the gate uses `window.crypto.subtle` in the browser. No third-party JS crypto library on either side.

This means: someone viewing the HTML source sees ciphertext, not plaintext. **It's still client-side**, so a determined attacker who watches a real user's browser memory could grab the decrypted content. We disclose this honestly in the skill flow and in the gate page footer ("client-side gate — disuasive, not authentication"). Real auth comes with V1.

The gate boilerplate lives in `alpha/templates/password-gate.html` and is the same for every doc.

---

## 9. Vercel integration

The CLI shells out to the official `vercel` CLI. We require it on PATH and instruct the user to install it during `init` if missing.

### First-run init flow (`flows/init`)

1. Check `vercel --version`. If missing, print install instructions and exit.
2. Check `vercel whoami`. If not logged in, run `vercel login` (interactive in a real terminal; in `--non-interactive` mode, instruct the skill to ask the user to log in manually first).
3. Ask for a project name. Default: `mirador-<username>`.
4. Run `vercel link --yes --name <project-name>` from a temporary directory to create the project.
5. Pull the resulting `.vercel/project.json` into our config.
6. Pick a default theme.
7. Persist `config.json`.

### Deploy

```
vercel deploy ~/.mirador/site --prod --yes --no-clipboard
```

The CLI parses stdout for the deployed URL (Vercel CLI prints `https://...` on success). If parsing fails, we fall back to the project's stable production domain stored in config (e.g. `https://mirador-danielm.vercel.app`), since Vercel always aliases that domain to the latest prod deploy. We then append `/d/<slug>/` to get the final doc URL.

### What if the user doesn't have Vercel?

The init flow detects this and explains:
> "Mirador needs a free Vercel account for the alpha. We don't host anything ourselves yet — your files live in your own account. Sign up at vercel.com, then re-run."

We do not block on Vercel-account creation, we just message and exit.

---

## 10. Distribution

Two install paths, both leading to the same `~/.mirador/` setup:

### One-liner

```
curl -fsSL https://mirador.dev/install.sh | sh
```

`install.sh` is committed in `alpha/install.sh`. It:

1. Requires Node 20+. Fails with a clear message otherwise.
2. Checks that `npm` global installs work without sudo (probes the npm global prefix; if it points under `/usr/local` and isn't user-writable, prints instructions for using `nvm` / `volta` or running with sudo, then exits non-zero). We do *not* silently `sudo`.
3. `npm i -g @mirador/cli`.
4. Runs `mirador skill install` (an internal command, not user-facing) which copies the skill bundle to `~/.claude/skills/mirador/`.
5. Prints next steps.

### npm

```
npm i -g @mirador/cli
mirador skill install   # hidden command, but documented in the README
```

### Uninstall

```
npm uninstall -g @mirador/cli
rm -rf ~/.mirador ~/.claude/skills/mirador
```

We document this in the README. We do *not* ship a `mirador uninstall` command — too rarely used to justify the surface.

---

## 11. Pinned decisions

- **Password = soft (client-side) gate, always.** Vercel Pro detection deferred to v0.2 (post-alpha).
- **Shipped themes:** `default`, `deck`, `memo`. No more in alpha; more come through user-generated themes.
- **Visible commands:** `share`, `list`. Period. No `theme`, no `init`, no `delete` as top-level — they live inside flows.
- **Hidden commands:** `mirador skill install` (called by installer only, documented in README). No others.
- **Skill never auto-runs.** It offers. The agent must ask the user before invoking.
- **AI calls** for theme generation use `claude-sonnet-4-6`; vision is built into Sonnet 4.6, no separate model required.

---

## 12. Success criteria

The alpha is successful when:

1. A first-time user with Node + a Vercel account can run `curl ... | sh` and have a working `mirador` in under 2 minutes.
2. From inside Claude Code, after producing an HTML file, the user can answer 3 conversational questions (name, theme, password) and have a URL in under 60 seconds (excluding Vercel deploy time, which we don't control).
3. Generating a theme from a screenshot of a real website produces a result that visibly resembles the reference for at least 8 of 10 test inputs (judged by the author; we don't ship without this bar).
4. The password gate, with a strong password, resists a 30-minute "view source and try to extract" attempt by a security-aware engineer who has the page but not the password.
5. The repo is public on GitHub with the README quickstart actually working on a fresh macOS and a fresh Ubuntu.

---

## 13. Roadmap

In order:

1. CLI scaffold (`alpha/package.json`, `src/index.ts`, command routing, `--non-interactive` flag).
2. Config module + first-run init flow (no Vercel yet — just config write).
3. Shipped themes (`default`, `deck`, `memo`) committed under `alpha/themes/`.
4. `theme/apply` — pure function with tests.
5. `site/build` — assemble the static site locally; verify by opening files in a browser.
6. Vercel integration (`flows/init` + `site/deploy`).
7. `share` command end-to-end with default theme, no password.
8. `flows/name`, `flows/password` (client-side gate), `flows/theme` (pick from list only).
9. `theme/generate` from URL / image / description.
10. `list` command (view, copy, open, delete).
11. Skill manifest (`SKILL.md`) + `mirador skill install`.
12. Installer (`install.sh`) + README + GIF demo.
13. Make the repo public.

---

## 14. Open questions

- Final installer domain (`mirador.dev`? something else?). Decision before public.
- Whether `list` should let the user re-share an existing doc with a different theme (basically "re-theme"). Tentative: yes, it's one extra branch in the same flow. Treats themes as mutable per-doc.
